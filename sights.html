      that stretches almost a mile and a half long. This is a unique concept as
      the park goes over the neighborhood its in, giving you unique views of the
      city. There are also different monuments on the highline that are all

    <p>
      First completed in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge became the first roadway
      connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan. This bridge is one of the most iconic
      places to walk in New York because of the stunning views of the city you
      get as you trek along the wooden boards. The city has also just recently
      constructed a bike path on the bridge which makes it a great spot to bike!
      The bridge takes about 30 minutes to walk across.

      is located in Sunset Park! This cemetery is massive at 478 acres and has

      even offers scenic views. A noteworthy place to visit within the cemetery
      is "Battle Hill," named after a battle that took place here during the
      American Revolution. Battle Hill is also the highest natural point in
