    <h1>What To Do In New York City</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is this site?</h3>
    <p>This site will be all about differnet things to do in New York, from the perspective of someone who has lived in Brooklyn, New York his entire life.</p>
    <h3>What is the purpose of this site?</h3>
    <p>New York City remains as one of the biggest tourists hotspots in America. While there are all sorts of websites showcasing different things to do in the city, the same "touristy" places are highlighted again and again. Having the perspective of a local, I will be able to highlight places that others won't know exist. I still may highlight "popular" places but will be drawing from my own experiences. </p>
    <h3>Who is the target audience?</h3>
    <p>As mentioned before, this site will be helpful to people are who are visiting New York City and want ideas on what to do and where to go. Additionally, this site may be helpful to college students who are planning to relocate and live in New York City after graduating.</p>
    <h3>What content will be included?</h3>
    <p>I plan to include the following pages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Things to See: Sight-seeing spots around the city. Will separate by free vs. paid experiences.</li>
        <li>Restaurants: I will talk about many of my favorite places to eat around the city!</li>
        <li>Dessert: I have always loved finding new spots to go to for dessert so I have many recommendations here.</li>
        <li>Bookstores: Going to bookstores is one of my favorite things to do in the city. There are so many to go to and I will talk about my favorites.</li>
        <li>Sunset Park section: Sunset Park is the neighborhood I grew up in and there is so much to do there. I will talk about many things to do in the neighborhood.</li>
        <li>and possibly more!</li>
    </ul>
